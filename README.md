# Lifesteal Plugin

Lifesteal is a mincraft plugin which adds a custom heart based system to your server.
In brief this plugin causes that player can have a different amount of hearts than normal by killing other players, dying due to them and getting killed by world (configurable).

Plugin also includes a full administration system (/adminhearts) where you can add, remove, reset, set and get info about player's hearts.

Everything is configurable in **configuration.yml**

# Supported versions
1.18 minecraft version:
- java 17+
- server version 1.18-1.18.2

# Placeholders
**Currently there are 2 placeholders:**

**%lifesteal_hearts%** - returns a plain amount of hearts (for instance - "5")

**%lifesteal_heartsformatted%** - returns a formatted (in configuration) amount of hearts (for instance a red text - "5â™¥")
